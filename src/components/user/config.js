                          If you happen to find yourself having dreams about binary (yes, ones and zeroes, because apparently, 
                          humans have reached the limit of craziness) engaging in some rather questionable activities, then 
                          congratulations! You've stumbled upon the right place to seek help. Feel free to connect with me 
                          from absolutely anywhere in the world. And don't worry, I promise I won't judge... much.`;
